This is sha256 implementation for CPU without using any header. all code is written here and suitable to be use in learning sha256. The code produce result equivalent to openssl header. 

For the input, i have hard code it into the program, so you may rework on this section to use difference input. THis code take an ASCII input. for binary input, little modification is required to pass binary unsigned char to the code.
